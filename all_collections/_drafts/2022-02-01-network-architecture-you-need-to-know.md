Networking architecture is the design and organization of the networks that allow us to access and share information with our devices. While the internet may be the most well-known, there are many different types that come in all shapes and sizes. Understanding these networks is crucial not only for the cyber security professionals who protect them, but also for developers who handle sensitive information in their applications. From small personal networks to large-scale ones, understanding the basics of network architecture can help you ensure the security of the data you handle. In this post, I'll share a high-level overview of the different types of networks, ranging from the smallest to the largest, so you can leave with a solid understanding of the basics.

## So what is a network anyway?

It's the system that connects two or more devices for transmitting data to each other, either through cables or a wireless signal. Networks can be broadly categorized into four types: Personal Area Networks (PANs), Local Area Networks (LANs), Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs), and Wide Area Networks (WANs). I will briefly describe each type and give a few examples.

### PANs, LANs, and MANs, oh my.

The smallest of the networks are the Personal Area Networks, or PANs. This is a low-range connection between devices. In simpler terms, this is the network for your personal devices such as your Bluetooth speaker or your smart watch, but also Near-Field Communication--this what your phone uses for Apple Pay or Android Pay.

Characteristics (e.g., small geographic scope, low data transfer speeds, used for personal devices)
Examples (e.g., Bluetooth, NFC)
Local Area Networks (LANs)

Personal Area Networks, or PANs, provide a low-range connection between devices, such as smartphones, laptops, and wearable devices, to share information and exchange data.

Characteristics (e.g., small geographic scope, low data transfer speeds, used for personal devices)
Examples (e.g., Bluetooth, NFC)
Local Area Networks (LANs)

"Local Area Networks, or LANs, are used to connect devices in a small, confined area, such as a home or an office, to share resources and exchange information."

Metropolitan Area Networks, or MANs,

Definition
Characteristics (e.g., large geographic scope, lower data transfer speeds compared to LANs)
Examples (e.g., corporate networks, the internet)
The Internet

"Wide Area Networks, or WANs, are used to connect multiple LANs in different locations, such as different offices or cities, to create a large network for data exchange and resource sharing."

The Internet:
"The Internet is the largest and most widely used network in the world, connecting billions of devices globally to exchange information and access resources."
